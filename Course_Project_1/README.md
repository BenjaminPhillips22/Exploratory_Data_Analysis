### Files

* seperate_our_data.R reads in the data from household_power_consumption.txt file (which can be obtained by downloading and unzipping https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) 
and writes the data for the dates 01-02-2007 and 02-02-2007 into two files; 01-02-2007.txt
 and 02-02-2007.txt

* plot1.R creates the plot1.png file
* plot2.R creates the plot2.png file
* plot3.R creates the plot3.png file
* plot4.R creates the plot4.png file


### Variables

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

* Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
* Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
* Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
* Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
* Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
* Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
* Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
* Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
* Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
